This example is designed for testing the MPU6050 Intertial Measurement Unit plugged into the back connector on the M5Stack Core Ink board, using pins `G21` (SDA) and `G22` (SCL) as well as `3V3` and `GND` connections.  The IMU's accelerometer X, Y, Z and gyroscope X, Y, Z values are printed to the Serial port.
